FAQ:
  - question: Are we allowed to use ChatGPT?
    answer: You are allowed to use ChatGPT as long you take it as an assistive tool.
  - question: Is there any late policy?
    answer: You have a total of 6 slip days that you can apply to your semester's homework. We will simply not award points for any late homework you submit that would bring your total slip days over six. If you are in the Disabled Students' Program and you are offered an extension, even with your extension plus slip days combined, no single assignment can be extended more than 5 days. (We have to grade them sometime!)
  - question: Are we referring to any books?
