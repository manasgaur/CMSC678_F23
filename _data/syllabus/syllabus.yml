     <h3>Bonus Grades For Final Project</h3>
     The bonus grades will be awarded based on the final project’s competency to be submitted to a machine learning, data science, or natural language processing conference. To decide on the bonus grades, I would lay emphasis on:
     <br>
     <ul>
     <li> Motivation and Problem Formulation, 
     <li> Literature Review,
     <li> Experiment and Dataset Design,
     <li> Results and Discussion,
     <li> Conclusion (What have been achieved, Limitations, and Future Work)
     </ul>  
     <h3>Template for the Final Project </h3>
     Please choose one of the following templates to submit the final project report:
     <ul>
     <li><a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/neurips-2022/kxymzbjpwsqx">NeurIPS Template</a>
     <li><a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-conference-proceedings-primary-article-template/wbvnghjbzwpc">ACM Official Template</a>
     </ul>

  - heading: Late Policy  
    content: "<ul>
    <li> A total of 6 days are granted. 
    <li> 50% credit for 24 hours after late days
    <li> Late days are for unforeseen situations (interviews, conference, etc.), do not include them in your plan
    </ul>
    <br> 
    <h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
    I take academic dishonesty seriously. Any sort of activity which relate the cheating, plagiarism, fabrication (e.g. use Adobe tools), or copy-paste will be not be tolerated. If caught for the first time would lead to a 50% reduction in the grade on the assignment. If the same activity is performed next, would result in an F grade in the course and a disciplinary action will be taken which may lead to suspension or dismissal.
    Please do visit the academic dishonesty policy available in the <a href="https://academicconduct.umbc.edu/">Academic Integrity at UMBC</a>.
    Especially for computer science classes, there are generally questions about what is and is not allowed. However, you may not write or complete assignments for another student; allow another student to write or complete your assignments; pair program; copy someone else’s work; or allow your work to be copied. This list is not inclusive."
