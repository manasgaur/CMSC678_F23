    <h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
    I take academic dishonesty seriously. Any sort of activity which relate the cheating, plagiarism, fabrication (e.g. use Adobe tools), or copy-paste will be not be tolerated. If caught for the first time would lead to a 50% reduction in the grade on the assignment. If the same activity is performed next, would result in an F grade in the course and a disciplinary action will be taken which may lead to suspension or dismissal.
    Please do visit the academic dishonesty policy available in the Academic Integrity at UMBC. Especially for computer science classes, there are generally questions about what is and is not allowed. However, you may not write or complete assignments for another student; allow another student to write or complete your assignments; pair program; copy someone else work; or allow your work to be copied. This list is not inclusive."
